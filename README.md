# Seizure-Detection-in-Epilectic-Patients
Epilepsy is a disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), affecting about 1.2% (3.4 million people) in the US, and more than 65 million globally. Additionally, about 1 in 26 people will develop epilepsy at some point during their lifetime.

The dataset for the project is available on UCIâ€™s machine learning repository here. The dataset includes 4097 electroencephalograms (EEG) readings per patient over 23.5 seconds, with 500 patients in total. The 4097 data points were then divided equally into 23 chunks per patient; each chunk is translated into one row in the dataset. Each row contains 178 readings that are turned into columns; in other words, there are 178 columns that make up one second of EEG readings. All in all, there are 11,500 rows and 180 columns with the first being patient ID and the last column containing the status of the patient, whether the patient is having a seizure or not.
